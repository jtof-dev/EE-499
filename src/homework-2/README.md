## 1. Daily Steps

- Arithmetic: 10751.6
- Harmonic: 504.8

Using the FitBit data, the four paricipants had an arithmetic mean of 10752 and a harmonic mean of 505. The arithmetic mean is much closer to the actual daily totals steps, while the harmonic mean is essentially a useless statistic here. Since the harmonic mean takes the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean, it is more useful in scenarios like rate problems, rather than flat numbers like steps per day.
