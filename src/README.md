# homework 1

- this is my first go at configuring latex, and I am using the `latex workshop` vscode extension

- aside from this, I also installed the following packages:

```
texlive-basic texlive-latexextra texlive-fontsrecommended texlive-fontsextra texlive-bibtexextra texlive-publishers texlive-mathscience texlive-bin perl-yaml-tiny perl-file-homedir
```

- in the future, I would like to migrate over to a terminal-based workflow with nvim plugins, but I don't know if that would actually be substantially easier than using vscode in this case (with vim keybinds)
