\section{Introduction}
Smart rings are a newly emerged wearable category, generally serving as a more minimalist alternative to smart watches. The Oura Ring was one of the first smart rings to come to market with a focus on health tracking, rather than the previous NFC-enabled smart rings~\cite{OuraWiki}. Since Oura’s launch in 2015, they have remained a constant in the smart ring space, even as competitors launched their own smart rings. In the past decade, the Oura Ring’s technology has been refined and homogenized across brands: sleep, activity, and general health are recorded by three to five sensors, and that data is interpreted by a companion phone app. Since most rings on the market follow this formula, their companies have to find something to specialize in to help them stand out from the rest.

Thanks to Oura’s relative longevity, their specialty is being the most well-rounded smart ring. Regardless of their ring’s comparative performance, they provide a consistently reliable product alongside a polished, useful phone app. One Oura competitor, the Samsung Galaxy Ring, differentiates itself by including tight software integration with their phones, most notably through finger tracking~\cite{SamsungRing}. The Ultrahuman Ring AIR is another contender with added emphasis on how to decrease stress and improve general health through tips on their app~\cite{Ultrahuman}. A last competitor is the RingConn Gen 2 Air, which positions itself as a budget alternative that does not compromise on data accuracy~\cite{RingConn}.
